                Admins can manage their students in the <b>Manage Students</b> section after logging in from the <b>Admin</b> section.
                They first choose a student avatar, then select a date range to view/edit their attendance.
                From here they can switch to table view for editing, if needed. Reports can be saved to PDF and printed as well.

                Admins can override the usual school calendar in the <b>Override Calendar</b> section
                for special holidays or unexpected time off like snow days. Admins can click on a day 
                of the month and exempt this day from the students' total hours requirement.
