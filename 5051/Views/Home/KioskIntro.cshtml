                Students can login and out using the kiosk from the <b>Kiosk Mode</b> section.
                Logging in or out earns them 100 points each. So for example, if a student
                logs in and out in the morning and afternoon, plus another login/logout around
                lunchtime, they will have earned 400 points for the day, to be spent in the student game
                section. Simply clicking on their avatar will log them in or out and confirm their login/logout times
                and points, which are saved in the Admin and Student sections.
                Students may also create a new account in the begining of their school year or anytime of the year.
